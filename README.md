# Caesar Cipher Encryption And Decryption App
### Description
Welcome to my project! This is a Caeasar Cipher Encryption and Decrption App made purely in Rust. 
It allows a user to encrypt and decrypt any message with shifts ranging from -26 to 26(-26 and 26 included).
With this app, you can effortlessly encrpyt and decrypt your messages easily. This is a project I built to utilize what I've been learning in my tutorials.
If there is any non-professional thing I did, I hope you can contribute and push or discuss. Thanks for using my app.
